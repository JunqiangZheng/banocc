## Introduction

Compositional data occur in many disciplines: geology, nutrition,
economics, and ecology, to name a few. Data are compositional when
each sample is sum-constrained. For example, mineral compositions
describe a mineral in terms of the weight percentage coming from
various elements; or taxonomic compositions break down a community by
the fraction of community memebers that come from a particular
species. In ecology in particular, the covariance between features is
often of interest to determine which species possibly interact with
each other. However, the sum constraint of compositional data makes
naive measures inappropriate.

BAnOCC is a package for analyzing compositional covariance while
accounting for the compositional structure. Briefly, the model assumes
that the unobserved counts are log-normally distributed and then
infers the correlation matrix of the log-basis (see [The Model]
section for a more detailed explanation). The inference is made using
No U-Turn Sampling for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [@HoffmanAndGelman2014]
as implemented in the `rstan` R package [@StanSoftware2015].

## How To Install
There are three options for installing BAnOCC:

* Within R
* Using compressed file from bitbucket
* Directly from bitbucket

### From Within R 
**This is not yet available**
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source("<bioconductor URL>")
biocLite("BAnOCC")
```

### From Bitbucket (Compressed File)
**This is not yet available**

### From Bitbucket (Directly) 

Clone the repository using `git clone`, which downloads the package as
its own directory called `banocc`.

```bash 
git clone https://<your-user-name>@bitbucket.org/biobakery/banocc.git
```

Then, install BAnOCC's dependencies. If these are already installed on
your machine, this step can be skipped.

```bash
Rscript -e "install.packages(c('rstan', 'mvtnorm', 'coda'))"
```

Lastly, install BAnOCC using `R CMD INSTALL`. Note that this _will
not_ automatically install the dependencies, so they must be installed
first.

```bash 
R CMD INSTALL banocc
```

## How To Run

### Loading
We first need to load the package:
```{r load, eval=TRUE}
library(banocc)
```

### Package Features
The BAnOCC package contains three things:

* `bayesStanModel`, which is the BAnOCC model in the  `rstan` format
* `run_banocc`, a wrapper function for `rstan::sampling` that samples
  from the model and returns a list with various useful elements
* Several test datasets which are included both as counts and as the
  corresponding compositions:

    Dataset Description           | Counts             | Composition
    ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------
    No correlations in the counts | `counts_null`      | `compositions_null`
    No correlations in the counts | `counts_hard_null` | `compositions_hard_null`
    Positive corr. in the counts  | `counts_pos_spike` | `compositions_pos_spike`
    Negative corr. in the counts  | `counts_neg_spike` | `compositions_neg_spike`


### Data and Prior Input 

For a full and complete description of the possible parameters for
`run_banocc`, their default values, and the output, see

```{r run-banocc-help, eval=FALSE} 
?run_banocc 
```

#### Required Input

There are only two required inputs to `run_banocc`:

1. The dataset `C`. This is assumed to be $N \times P$, with $N$
samples and $P$ features. The row sums are therefore required to be
less than one for all samples.
1. The compiled stan model `banocc_model`. The compiled model is
required so that `run_banocc` doesn't need to waste time compiling the
model every time it is called. To compile, use
`rstan::stan_model(model_code=banocc::banocc_model)`.

The simplest way to run the model is to load a test dataset, compile
the model, and sample from it (this gives a warning because the
default number of iterations is low):

```{r rerun, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
rerun <- 1
```

```{r basic-run-banocc, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
data(compositions_null)
banocc_model <- rstan::stan_model(model_code = banocc::banocc_model) 
b_output     <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null, banocc_model=banocc_model)
```


#### Hyperparameters

The hyperparameter values can be specified as input. Their names
correspond to the parameters in the plate diagram figure (see section
[The Model]). For example,

```{r input-hyperparameters, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"} 
p <- ncol(compositions_null)
b_hp <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null, 
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           n = rep(0, p),
                           L = 10 * diag(p), 
                           a = rep(1,   p),
                           b = rep(0.5, p),
                           eta = 1)
```

The hyperparameter values for **$s$**, the standard deviations of the
log-transformed basis, can be alternatively specified as the means and
variances of the prior using the parameters `sd_mean` and
`sd_var`. This is because the mean of a Gamma distribution is $a_j /
b_j$, and the variance is $a_j / b_j^2$. For example,

```{r input-sd-mean, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
# This is the same prior as above
b_sd_mean <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                                banocc_model = banocc_model,
                                sd_mean = rep(2, p),
                                sd_var  = rep(4, p))
```

### Sampling Control

There are several options to control the behavior of the HMC
sampler. This is simply a call to `rstan::sampling`, and so many of
the parameters are the same. 

#### General Sampling Control

The number of chains, iterations, and warmup iterations as well as the
rate of thinning can be specified using the same parameters as for
`rstan::sampling` and `rstan::stan`. For example, the following code
gives a total of three iterations from each of two chains. These
parameters are used only for brevity and are NOT recommended in
practice.

```{r sampling-sampling, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
b_sampling <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                                 banocc_model = banocc_model,
                                 chains = 2,
                                 iter = 11,
                                 warmup = 5,
                                 thin = 2)
```

#### Number of Cores

The number of cores used for sampling on a multi-processor machine can
also be specified, which allows chains to run in parallel and
therefore decreases computation time. Since its purpose is running
chains in parallel, computation time will decrease as cores are added
up to when the number of cores and the number of chains are equal.

```{r sampling-cores, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
b_cores <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                              banocc_model = banocc_model,
                              chains = 2,
                              cores = 2)
```

#### Initial Values

The initial values are sampled from the priors by default because the
positive definite constraint on the covariance matrix makes it
difficult for `rstan::sampling` to generate initial values
automatically. They can also be set to a particular value by using a
list. `WChol` is the cholesky decomposition of **$W$** that is used by
the sampler for computational reasons.

```{r sampling-init, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
init <- list(list(m = rep(0, p),
                  WChol = t(chol(diag(p))),
		  s = rep(1, p)),
             list(m = runif(p),
                  WChol = t(chol(2 * diag(p))),
                  s = runif(p, 0.1, 2)))
b_init <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                             banocc_model = banocc_model,
                             chains = 2,
                             init = init)
```

More specific control of the sampler's behavior comes from the
`control` argument to `rstan::sampling`. Details about this argument
can be found in the help for the `rstan::stan` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?stan
```

### Output Control

There are several parameters that control the type of output which is
returned.

#### Credible Interval Width

The width of the returned credible intervals is controlled by
`conf_alpha`. A $100\% * (1-\alpha_\text{conf})$ credible interval is
returned:

```{r output-ci, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
# Get 90% credible intervals
b_90 <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           conf_alpha = 0.1)
# Get 99% credible intervals
b_99 <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           conf_alpha = 0.01)
```

#### Checking Convergence

Convergence is evaluated automatically, and in this case the credible
intervals, estimates, and any additional output in section [Additional
Output] is missing. This behavior can be turned off using the
`eval_convergence` option. But be careful!

```{r eval-convergence, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
# Default is to evaluate convergence
b_ec <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           chains = 1)

# This can be turned off using `eval_convergence`
b_nec <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                            banocc_model = banocc_model,
                            chains = 1,
                            eval_convergence = FALSE)
```

```{r show-eval-convergence, eval=TRUE}
# Iterations are too few, so estimates are missing
b_ec$Estimates.median

# Convergence was not evaluated, so estimates are not missing
b_nec$Estimates.median
```

#### Additional Output

Two types of output can be requested for each correlation that are not
included by default:

1. The smallest credible interval width that includes zero
1. The scaled neighborhood criterion, or SNC [@LiAndLin2010]

```{r output-extra, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE, dependson=c('rerun'), results="hide"}
# Get the smallest credible interval width that includes zero
b_min_width <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                                  banocc_model = banocc_model,
                                  get_min_width = TRUE)

# Get the scaled neighborhood criterion
b_snc <- banocc::run_banocc(C = compositions_null,
                            banocc_model = banocc_model,
                            calc_snc = TRUE)
```

Detailed statements about the function's execution can also be printed
using the `verbose` argument. The relative indentation of the verbose
output indicates the nesting level of the function. The starting
indentation can be set with `num_level`.

## Assessing Convergence

There are many ways of assessing convergence, but the two most easily implemented using BAnOCC are:

1. Traceplots of parameters, which show visually what values of a
parameter have been sampled across all iterations. At convergence, the
sampler should be moving rapidly across the space, and the chains
should overlap well. In other words, it should look like grass.

1. The Rhat statistic [@GelmanAndRubin1992], which measures agreement
between all the chains. It should be close to one at convergence.

### Traceplots

Traceplots can be directly accessed using the `traceplot` function in
the `rstan` package, which creates a `ggplot2` object that can be
further maniuplated to 'prettify' the plot. The traceplots so
generated are for the samples drawn _after_ the warmup period. For
example, we could plot the traceplots for the correlations of feature
1 with all other features. There is good overlap between the chains,
but we need more samples from the posterior to be confident of
convergence.

```{r traceplot, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# The correlations of feature 1 with all other features
rstan::traceplot(b_output$Fit, pars=paste0("W[1,", 2:9, "]"))
```

We could also see the warmup period samples by using
`inc_warmup=TRUE`. This shows that the chains have moved from very
different starting points to a similar distribution, which is a good
sign of convergence.

```{r traceplot-warmup, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# The correlations of feature 1 with all other features, including warmup
rstan::traceplot(b_output$Fit, pars=paste0("W[1,", 2:9, "]"),
                 inc_warmup=TRUE)
```

### Rhat Statistics

The Rhat values can also be directly accessed using the `summary`
function in the `rstan` package. It measures the degree of agreement
between all the chains. At convergence, the Rhat statistics should be
approximately one for all parameters. For example, the Rhat values for
the correlation between feature 1 and all other features (the same as
those plotted above), agree with the traceplots that convergence has
not yet been reached.

```{r Rhat, eval=TRUE, cache=TRUE}
# This returns a named vector withthe Rhat values for all parameters
rhat_all <- rstan::summary(b_output$Fit)$summary[, "Rhat"]

# To see the Rhat values for the correlations of feature 1
rhat_all[paste0("W[1,", 2:9, "]")]
```

## Choosing Priors

The hyperparameters for the model (see section [The Model]) need to be
chosen appropriately.

### Log-Basis Correlation Matrix

The prior on the correlation matrix **$W$** is an LKJ distribution
with parameter $\eta$ [see section [The Model] and
@LewandowskiEtAl2009]. When $\eta = 1$, this prior is uniform over the
space of positive definite correlation matrices. As $\eta$ increases,
the prior probability mass for each correlation becomes more and more
concentrated around 0, which can be seen in the figures below.

![eta 1](prior_eta_1_n_1000_W.png)
![eta 10](prior_eta_10_n_1000_W.png)
![eta 25](prior_eta_25_n_1000_W.png)

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# To make the above plots, use
# for eta in 1 10 25; do ~/sfle/input/ccrepe_validation/src/plot_priors.R --plotFileName ~/banocc_project/banocc/vignettes/prior_eta_$eta_n_1000_%03d.png --theme_text_size 12 --eta $eta --verbose True -p 4; done
```

### Log-Basis Mean and Standard Deviations

We recommend plotting _both_ the explicit priors on the log-basis
means and standard deviations as well as the implicit priors on the
un-transformed basis means and standard deviations.

## The Model

A pictoral representation of the model is shown below. Briefly, the
basis (or unobserved, unrestricted counts) for each sample is assumed
to be a lognormal distribution with parameters **$m$** and
**$S$**. The prior on **$m$** is a normal distribution parametrized by
mean **$n$** and variance-covariance matrix **$L$**. Since we are
interested in the correlation structure, we break **$S$** into a
correlation matrix **$W$** and a vector of standard deviations
**$s$**. The prior on **$W$** is an LKJ distribution
[@LewandowskiEtAl2009] with shrinkage parameter $\eta$, while the
prior on eash $s_j$ is a gamma prior with shape $a_j$ and rate $b_j$.


![plate-diagram](Figure3.png)


If we print the model, we can actually see the code. It is written in
the format required by the `rstan` package, since `banocc` uses this
package to sample from the model. See [@StanManual2015] for more
detailed information on this format.

```{r model, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
cat(banocc::banocc_model)
```
