## Introduction

Compositional data occur in many disciplines: geology, nutrition,
economics, and ecology, to name a few. Data are compositional when
each sample is sum-constrained. For example, mineral compositions
describe a mineral in terms of the weight percentage coming from
various elements; or taxonomic compositions break down a community by
the fraction of individuals that come from a particular species. In
ecology in particular, the covariance between features is often of
interest to determine which species possibly interact with each
other. However, the sum constraint of compositional data makes naive
measures inappropriate.

BAnOCC is a package for analyzing compositional covariance while
accounting for the compositional structure. Briefly, the model assumes
that the unobserved counts are log-normally distributed and then
infers the correlation matrix of the log-basis (see [The Model]
section for a more detailed explanation). The inference is made using
No U-Turn Sampling for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo [@HoffmanAndGelman2014]
as implemented in the `rstan` R package [@StanSoftware2015].

## How To Install
There are three options for installing BAnOCC:

* Within R
* Using compressed file from bitbucket
* Directly from bitbucket

### To install from within R 
**This is not yet available**
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
source("<bioconductor URL>")
biocLite("BAnOCC")
```

### To install using a compressed file from bitbucket
**This is not yet available**

### To install directly from bitbucket
```bash
git clone https://<your-user-name>@bitbucket.org/biobakery/banocc.git
R CMD INSTALL banocc
```

## How To Run
We first need to load the package:
```{r load, eval=TRUE}
library(banocc)
```
The BAnOCC package contains three things:

* `bayesStanModel`, which is the BAnOCC model in the  `rstan` format
* `run_banocc`, a wrapper function for `rstan::sampling` that samples
  from the model and returns a list with various useful elements
* `banocc_data`, a small test dataset

The simplest way to run the model is to load the test dataset, compile
the model, and sample from it: 

```{r basic-run-banocc, eval=FALSE} 
# This code is not run 
data(banocc_data) 
banocc_model  <- rstan::stan_model(model_code=banocc_model) 
banocc_output <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data, banocc_model=banocc_model) 
```

For a full and complete description of the possible parameters for
`run_banocc`, their default values, and the output, see

```{r run-banocc-help, eval=FALSE} 
?run_banocc 
```

### Data and Prior Input 

The only required input to `run_banocc` is the dataset, `C`. This is
assumed to be $n \times p$, with $n$ samples and $p$ features. The row
sums are therefore required to be less than 1 for all samples.

The hyperparameter values can be specified as input. Their names
correspond to the parameters in the plate diagram figure (see section
[The Model]). For example,

```{r input-hyperparameters, eval=FALSE} 
# This code is not run
p <- ncol(banocc_data)
b_hp <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data, 
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           n = rep(0, p),
                           L = 10 * diag(p), 
                           a = rep(1,   p),
                           b = rep(0.5, p),
                           eta = 1)
```

The hyperparameter values for **$s$** can be alternatively specified
as the means and variances of the prior using the parameters `sd_mean`
and `sd_var`. For example,

```{r input-sd-mean, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
b_sd_mean <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                                banocc_model = banocc_model,
                                sd_mean = rep(2, p),
                                sd_var  = rep(4, p))
```

### Sampling Control

There are several options to control the behavior of the HMC
sampler. This is simply a call to `rstan::sampling`, and so many of
the parameters are the same. The number of chains, iterations, and
warmup iterations as well as the rate of thinning can be specified
using the same parameters. For example, the following code gives a
total of three iterations from each of two chains. These parameters
are used only for brevity and are NOT recommended in practice.

```{r sampling-sampling, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
b_sampling <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                                 banocc_model = banocc_model,
                                 chains = 2,
                                 iter = 11,
                                 warmup = 5,
                                 thin = 2)
```

The number of cores used for sampling on a multi-processor machine can
also be specified, which allows chains to run in parallel and
therefore decreases computation time. Since its purpose is running
chains in parallel, computation time will decrease as cores are added
up to when the number of cores and the number of chains are equal.

```{r sampling-cores, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
b_cores <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                              banocc_model = banocc_model,
                              chains = 2,
                              cores = 2)
```

The initial values are sampled from the priors by default because the
positive definite constraint on the covariance matrix makes it
difficult for `rstan::sampling` to generate initial values
automatically. They can also be set to a particular value by using a
list. `WChol` is the cholesky decomposition of **$W$** that is used by
the sampler for computational reasons.

```{r sampling-init, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
init <- list(list(m = rep(0, p),
                  WChol = t(chol(diag(p))),
		  s = rep(1, p)),
             list(m = runif(p),
                  WChol = t(chol(2 * diag(p))),
                  s = runif(p, 0.1, 2)))
b_init <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                             banocc_model = banocc_model,
                             chains = 2,
                             init = init)
```

More specific control of the sampler's behavior comes from the
`control` argument to `rstan::sampling`. Details about this argument
can be found in the help for the `rstan::stan` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?stan
```

### Output Control

There are several parameters that control the type of output which is
returned.

The width of the returned credible intervals is controlled by
`conf_alpha`. A $100\% * (1-\alpha_\text{conf})$ credible interval is
returned:

```{r output-ci, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run

# Get 90% credible intervals
b_90 <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           conf_alpha = 0.1)
# Get 99% credible intervals
b_99 <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                           banocc_model = banocc_model,
                           conf_alpha = 0.01)
```

Two types of output can be requested for each correlation that are not
included by default:

1. The smallest credible interval width that includes zero
1. The scaled neighborhood criterion, or SNC [@LiAndLin2010]

```{r output-extra, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run

# Get the smallest credible interval width that includes zero
b_min_width <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                                  banocc_model = banocc_model,
                                  get_min_width = TRUE)

# Get the scaled neighborhood criterion
b_snc <- banocc::run_banocc(C = banocc_data,
                            banocc_model = banocc_model,
                            calc_snc = TRUE)
```

Detailed statements about the function's execution can also be printed
using the `verbose` argument. The relative indentation of the verbose
output indicates the nesting level of the function. The starting
indentation can be set with `num_level`.

### The Model

A pictoral representation of the model is shown below. Briefly, the
basis (or unobserved, unrestricted counts) for each sample is assumed
to be a lognormal distribution with parameters **$m$** and
**$S$**. The prior on **$m$** is a normal distribution parametrized by
mean **$n$** and variance-covariance matrix **$L$**. Since we are
interested in the correlation structure, we break **$S$** into a
correlation matrix **$W$** and a vector of standard deviations
**$s$**. The prior on **$W$** is an LKJ distribution
[@LewandowskiEtAl2009] with shrinkage parameter $\eta$, while the
prior on eash $s_j$ is a gamma prior with shape $a_j$ and rate $b_j$.


![plate-diagram](Figure3.png)


If we print the model, we can actually see the code. It is written in
the format required by the `rstan` package, since `banocc` uses this
package to sample from the model.
```{r model, eval=FALSE}
# This code is not run
cat(bayesStanModel)
```
